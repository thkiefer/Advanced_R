In the first study, key persons from institutions for higher education were asked to determine the minimally required language level of beginning students. In the second study, a standard setting method is used to determine whether examinees who pass the state examination are at the required level. This amounts to an evaluation of the current cutscores in relation to the CEFR. The results of the examinations for speaking and writing are reported.},

  Abstract                 = {The most frequently used measures of halo are based on interdimension correlations (the correlation, or r, measure) or within-ratee variability across dimensions (the standard deviation, or SD, measure). Pulakos, Schmitt, and Ostroff argued that the r measure is conceptually appropriate and demonstrated that the SD measure does not always yield results consistent with the r measure. They therefore concluded that the SD measure should not be used. This article critiques the r measure, responds to criticisms of the SD measure, and describes conditions under which halo effects can occur and (a) both measures can be obtained, (b) one of the measures can be obtained, but the other measure either cannot be obtained or should not be used, and (c) neither measure can be obtained. Thus neither measure is uniformly superior to the other. It is therefore recommended that both measures be obtained when possible and when there is no basis for selecting one over the other.},

  Abstract                 = {The Bookmark method for setting standards on educational tests is currently one of the most popular standard-setting methods. However, research to support the method is scarce. In this report, we review the published and unpublished literature on this method as well as some seminal work in the area of evaluating standard-setting studies. Our review highlights both strengths and limitations of the method. Strengths include its wide acceptance and panelist confidence in the method. Limitations include a potential bias to produce lower-than-intended standards and problems in selecting the most appropriate response probability value for ordering the items presented to panelists. It is clear that more research on this method is needed to support its wide use. Several areas for future research to better understand the validity of the Bookmark method for setting standards on educational tests are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Second language performance tests, through the richness of the assessment context, introduce a range of facets which may influence the chances of success of a candidate on the test. This study investigates the potential roles of Generalizability theory (G-theory) (Brennan, 1983; Shavelson and Webb, 1991) and Many-facet Rasch measurement (Linacre, 1989; Linacre and Wright, 1993; McNamara, 1996) in the development of such a performance-based assessment procedure. This represents an extension of preliminary investigations into the relative contributions of these procedures (e.g., Bachman et al., 1995) to another assessment setting. Data for this study come from a trial of materials from the access: test, a test of communicative skills in English as a Second Language for intending immigrants to Australia. The performances of 83 candidates on the speaking skills module were multiply rated and analysed using GENOVA (Crick and Brennan, 1984) and FACETS (Linacre and Wright, 1993). The advantages and specific roles of these contrasting analytical techniques are considered in detail in the light of this assessment context.},

  Abstract                 = {Develops the concepts behind plausible values in a simplified setting, sketches their use in the National Assessment of Educational Progress, and illustrates the approach with data from the Scholastic Aptitude Test. The multiple-matrix item sampling designs that provide information about population characteristics most efficiently administer too few responses to students to estimate their proficiencies individually. Marginal estimation procedures, which estimate population characteristics directly from item responses, must be employed to realize the benefits of such a sampling design. Numerical approximations of the appropriate marginal estimation procedures for a broad variety of analyses can be obtained by constructing, from the results of a comprehensive extensive marginal solution, files of plausible values of student proficiencies.

  Abstract                 = {Standard-setting procedures are a key component within many large-scale educational assessment systems. They are consensual approaches in which committees of experts set cut-scores on continuous proficiency scales, which facilitate communication of proficiency distributions of students to a wide variety of stakeholders. This communicative function makes standard-setting studies a key gateway for validity concerns at the intersection of evidentiary and consequential aspects of score interpretations. This short review paper describes the conceptual and empirical basis of validity arguments for standard-setting procedures in light of recent research on validity theory. It specifically demonstrates how procedural and internal evidence for the validity of standard-setting procedures can be collected to form part of the consequential basis of validity evidence for test use.},

  Abstract                 = {There has been much discussion recently about why the percentage of students scoring Proficient or above varies as much as it does on state assessments across the country. However, most of these discussions center on the leniency or rigor of the cut score. Yet, the cut score is developed in a standard-setting process that depends heavily on the definition for each level of performance. Good performance-level descriptors (PLDs) can be the foundation of an assessment program, driving everything from item development to cut scores to reporting. PLDs should be written using a multistep process. First, policymakers determine the number and names of the levels. Next, they develop policy definitions specifying the level of rigor intended by each level, regardless of the grade or subject to which it is applied. Finally, content experts and education leaders should supplement these policy definitions with specific statements related to the content standards for each assessment. This article describes a process for developing PLDs, contrasts that with current state practice, and discusses the implication for interpreting the word √¢‚Ç¨≈ìproficient,√¢‚Ç¨? which is the keystone of No Child Left Behind.},

  Abstract                 = {Publisher Summary This chapter describes the common forms of Multidimensional Item Response Theory (MIRT) models and the mathematical expressions for \{MIRT\} models. It also provides a general conceptual framework for the use of \{MIRT\} models. \{MIRT\} models are typically models for the relationship between the probability of a response to one item and the location of a person in the coordinate space. The model only contains parameters for the characteristics of one item and the location for one person. The item parameters are assumed to be constant. The probability of correct response to the item changes with the location of the person. The model is not for the sets of items, although a number of items are analyzed at the same time during the estimation of item parameters and tests of fit of the models to item response data. It is always possible to fit a model to the data from one item. The simultaneously fitting of the model to multiple items is a stringent test of the usefulness of the model. },

  Abstract                 = { How to compute and report subscores for a test that was originally designed for reporting scores on a unidimensional scale has been a topic of interest in recent years. In the research reported here, we describe an application of multidimensional item response theory to identify a subscore structure in a test designed for reporting results using a unidimensional scale. This research also dealt with the problem of planned missing data due to low levels of item overlap among multiple test forms. Furthermore, we provided evidence for the generalizability of the multidimensional structure using multiple forms of the same test. We also compared the subscores from multiple groups to show the usefulness of the subscores. The research provides evidence that subscores can be identified and produced to provide useful information about different constructs for multiple examinee groups even though the test data were well fit by a unidimensional model.},

  Abstract                 = {This study describes the use of generalizability theory (GT) and many-facet Rasch measurement (MFRM) to evaluate psychometric properties of responses obtained from an assessment designed to measure complex problem-solving skills. The assessment revolved around the school activity of kickball. The task required of each student was to decide on a team T-shirt based on visual characteristics of the T-shirts and written descriptions of other T-shirt characteristics. Forty-four fourth-grade students, comprising the control group of a longitudinal research project to foster complex problem-solving skills of disadvantaged urban youth, participated in this study. Results indicate both measurement techniques agree on the relative magnitudes of variation among the facets but differ on how to handle the sources of variation.},

  abstract   = {The aim of this linking study is to classify the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) according to the criterion based reference frame of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). One requirement for a strong linking is a high conceptual overlap of the frameworks. The results of the comparison between NEPS and TIMSS indicate a high overlap. To link the studies the equipercentile equating and an IRT linking approach are compared. The results show that both methods showed similar descriptive statistics and satisfying classiÔ¨Åcation consistency. Nevertheless, the equipercentile equating has small advantages and is therefore more suitable. Thus, inferences are possible on a population level, but the results should not be reported or interpreted on an individual level.},

  abstract   = {The assessment of mathematical competence for ninth graders in the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS-K9) and the German National Assessment at the end of secondary education (LV) show a large conceptual overlap. To examine the possibility of transferring the LV performance standards to the test scores of the NEPS-K9, a linking study was set up with N = 636 students which examined mathematics items from both tests in a single group design. The NEPS test scores were linked to the LV test with the equipercentile method. The distributions of the scores in both the LV and NEPS test as well as the distribution that resulted out of the linking were compared. Furthermore, the robustness of the linking was analysed by subgroup and classiÔ¨Åcation consistency. The linking produced similar distributions of scores and performance standards but differed signiÔ¨Åcantly for the individual classiÔ¨Åcations. Thus, inferences are possible on a population level, but the results should not be interpreted on an individual level.},
